# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Final Product
1. The Tweeter app is responsive where the user profile becomes a part of the header when the screen size is under 1024px

2. The tweet submission form includes error handling and form validation where if there's nothing in the textarea or if it exceeds 140 character limit, the user is shown a feedback. Otherwise, the tweet will post successfully!
